MAPPINGS FAMOUS PLUGINS                         *bim-plugins*

Bim includes mapping for famous plugins so that they work better with bepo
layout. Bim try to preserve as many original mappings as possible and mainly
remaps the home row keys when there is a conflict.

To enable them, add this in your .vimrc:

    " vim-commentary mappings
    let g:bim_remap_commentary = 1
    " vim-fugitive mappings
    let g:bim_remap_fugitive   = 1
    " vim-surround mappings
    let g:bim_remap_surround   = 1

CUSTOMIZING                                     *bim-customizing*

You can disable some of the mappings by categeries by adding some settings in
your .vimrc.

Do not move $ to è, and do not create mappings starting by $:

    let g:bim_remap_dollar = 0

Do not remap w to é:

    let g:bim_remap_word = 0

Do not remap æ to CTRL-w with additionnal mappings:

    let g:bim_remap_window = 0

Do not remap à to " with additionnal mappings:
    let g:bim_remap_registers = 0

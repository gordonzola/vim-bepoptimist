INTRODUCTION                                    *bim*

Bim is a vim plugin that remaps and adds vim keymaps for Bépo keyboard.
*Bim* is for *Bépo IMproved*.

It does more than just remapping *jklm* and suggest a lot of keymaps that
have been designed to be easy to access in bépo layout. It also take advantage
of keys not available or hard to access in qwerty or azerty layouts, like œ,
æ, …

This plugin is under development, **no backward compatibility guaranteed** for
now. I am style looking for ways to take advantage of the bepo layout as much
as possible. Suggestions are very welcome.

MAPPINGS                                        *bim-mappings*

The philosophy of this plugin is to keep vim native keys if possible, while
preserving the position of the home row. The remapping of the home row is
optional. It regroups mappings by categories using a prefix for each group.
Default is:

    é       buffer prefix
    é       buffer operator
    É       window prefix
    à       option prefix

    Coming soon: other prefix

Exemples:

    " new buffer operator (é is for [é]cran)
    yé      Yank all buffer content
    =é      Retab all buffer content
    gqé     Reformat all buffer content

    " buffer prefix "é"
    éé      Previous buffer
    éc      Move to previous buffer
    ér      Move to next buffer

    " Window prefix "É"
    ÉÉ      Previous window
    Éc      Move to left window
    Ét      Move to bottom window

    " Option prefix "à"
    àp      Toggle paste
    àr      Toggle relative number
    àf      Toggle folding
    àev     Edit vimrc
    àsv     Source vimrc


MAPPINGS FAMOUS PLUGINS                         *bim-plugins*

Bim includes mapping for famous plugins so that they work better with bepo
layout. Bim try to preserve as many original mappings as possible and mainly
remaps the home row keys when there is a conflict.

Plugins recognized by vim are:

- Unite by Shougo Matsushita : fixes home row keys
- vim-sneak by Justin M. Keyes : replace s by è by default
- vim-commentary by Tim Pope : fix cg* mapping (c is take in home row)
- vim-surround by Tim Pope : fix cs mapping (c is taken in home row)
- vim-fugitive by Tim Pope : optional mapping for easy access to git features


CUSTOMIZING                                     *bim-customizing*

Bim also try to detect the bepo layout and quit if nothing is detected. This
is experimental. You can force bepo layout in your .vimrc:

    let g:bepo_enable = 1

If you do not wish to remap the home row and are using the keyboard arrows:

    let g:bim_remap_homerow = 0

Enable fugitive mappings:

    let g:bim_map_fugitive


You can change the prefix keys by settings them in your vimrc. This is the
default settings:

    let g:bim_option_prefix   = 'à'
    let g:bim_buffer_prefix   = 'é'
    let g:bim_window_prefix   = 'É'
    let g:bim_buffer_operator = 'é'
